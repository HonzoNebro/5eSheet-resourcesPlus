## Usage

### Global limit

By default you only have to change the module setting to add more resource fields.

&nbsp;

### ❗ Per sheet limit

❗ Journal configuration is still W.I.P. and not available yet.

❗ Toggle the "settings type" setting to Journal mode.

❗ Create a journal with the name you put in the module settings. (default: `Resource Count`)

❗ Then in that journal you can add sheets that you want a custom journal amount for.

❗ To add a new journal, drag a journal into the sheet (make sure it's a new line). Then add the number of resources you want that sheet to have to the right of the entry.

* **You can't have more than 20 resources.**
* **Make sure you only have one sheet per line.**
